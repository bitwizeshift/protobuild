Protobuild is the missing coordinator/build-system for [protobuf] projects.

This offers an easy, data-driven build-system for generating protobuf
definitions.

`protobuild` is **free** for teams and companies to use, and always will be.
No subscription is required, like _some other tools_.

## Teaser

```bash
$ protobuild generate my-project
target my-project depends on protocolbuffers/protobuf, google/fhir

## Why?

Anyone who has worked in a large project with a lot of protocol buffers knows
what a pain it is to coordinate the generation of protobuf definitions. It
becomes more complicated as more target-languages and plugins get into the mix,
and overall has no _good_ solution to this.

Some products exist in the market, like [`buf`], which privatizes and
centralizes registries behind a **paid subscription**. This forces a separate
and orthogonal system for something that can easily be done locally; and
`protobuild` aims to make this as easily and painlessly as possible.

## Project Goals

The `protobuild` project aims to provide a safe, easy, and **free** mechanism
to control building and generating Protocol buffers.

Below are some goals of this project:

* [ ] Allow user-definitions of external protobuf projects
* [ ] Allow custom `git`-driven registries of public protobuf projects, so that
      teams may centralize their definitions.
* [ ] Dependency tracing of protobuf projects.
* [ ] Manage recipes for `protoc` plugin installations to better centralize this.
* [ ] GitHub action support
* [ ] Provide hosted JSON Schema definitions of the project files
