# Project Governance

This project is a hobby-project I started for myself ([@bitwizeshift]) to handle
protocol-buffer generation management. This does not currently allow outside
contributions, and as such the direction of the design and project management
is all limited to handling the problems I am currently encountering.

This will change in the future.
