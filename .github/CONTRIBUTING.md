# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project! I sincerely appreciate your
enthusiasm and eagerness to contribute, as public contributions are
fundamental to the open-source community.

However, at this moment, I am **not actively accepting external contributions**,
though I intend to in the future! Currently this project is guided by my own
explicit practical needs, and wish to steer the project in a directed way.
Once it's at a more stable point, I will open up contribution support; so please
consider starring this project to keep an eye on future updates for
opportunities to contribute and collaborate.
Your support and understanding are highly valued!
