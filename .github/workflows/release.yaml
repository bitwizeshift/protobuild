  # The actions/attest API doesn't make it easy to attest SBOM provenance and
  # associate it with a specific build if it's being globbed. An unfortunate
  # consequence of that is that the only way to do this is to unroll the
  # attestation so that it's done individually per step. This either means
  # itemizing it N times, which is ugly -- or to use a matrix strategy to
  # attest them all; which is easier to maintain, but requires downloading the
  # created artifact. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.
